    Branching is a feature available in Git which lets you diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work without messing with that main line. Here are some commands related to branching:

    - **git branch**: Lists all the local branches in the current repository.
    - **git branch [name]**: Creates a new branch.
    - **git checkout [name]**: Switches to the specified branch.
    - **git merge [branch]**: Merges the specified branchâ€™s history into the current branch.
